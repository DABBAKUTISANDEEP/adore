# Vehicle-to-X radio communication interface via ROS
The package v2x_if_ros contains ROS adaptations for ITSG5.
A set of transceiver nodes is run in ROS subsystem. The transceiver nodes relay between UDP streams connected to V2X hard- and software and the ROS subsystem.

## Folders

- [autogenerated](autogenerated): autogenerated source code for ROS transceivers nodes. This folder contains header files, implementation files and .msg files ready to be compliled using catkin
- [v2xsim](v2xsim): Simulation of v2x messages, using autogenerated ROS messages with a channel model.
- Java V2X transceivers that connect ROS translators nodes with the CCU (communication-control-unit) are currently not published
